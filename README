Facebook™ 'share' action that doesn't suck!

Ever tried to share a link from the browser using the official Facebook™ app?  Noticed how it actually opens a web page and the process is very sluggish and incredibly irritating [with all due respect to Facebook™ ;)]?

Well now you can use this little app instead!  All it does is post a link to your Facebook™ wall - but in a smooth way, like it ought to be!

The app will return immediately and stay in the background to post the link.  If there is a network problem, it will quietly retry a few times before giving you a warning message.
